With **URL Terminator** you have to possibility to block your own distractions. Just add in your desired URLs, turn on the blocker and voil√†. It will automatically close any opened tabs pointing to your blocked URLs. Of course, you can block just specific paths within a website (e.g. www.example.com/specific-path) and have the rest of the website unblocked.

It's that simple!
