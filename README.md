# URL Terminator
A minimal URL blocker to help you stay focused whilst working. Keep your attention!

Extension link on *Chrome Web Store*: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-terminator/cdbogljgacceohhekedgkcfglicmgnnf

▸ Why give it a try?

✔ Block any URL you want by adding it to the list and turning off the blocker.  
✔ Block only a specific path of a domain if you don't want to block an entire website.  
✔ Escape an entire domain or subpaths from being blocked. Just add "!" at the start of an URL and you're done!  
✔ Keep your list saved and just toggle the blocker whenever you want.  
✔ It's open-source!  

▸ Notes

• If you add a domain any subpaths of that domain will be blocked (e.g. if www.example.com is blocked then www.example.com/subpath is blocked as well).  
• Escaping is more powerful than blocking. In other words, if you blocked a subpath of a domain but the domain itself is escaped, that means your subpath will also be escaped. As a workaround you can just delete the escaped domain.  

Have a quick look at the interface:
